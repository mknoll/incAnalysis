Description: Easy evaluation of predictive performance for different rate prediction approaches as forward projection of last observations, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and a specific Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort Model. Both INLA and classical Maximum Likelihood approaches can be used for GLMs and GAMs.
