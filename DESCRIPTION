Title: Comparative Analysis of Model Performances for Rate Data
Version: 0.9
Authors@R: person("Maximilian", "Knoll", email = "m.knoll@dkfz.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Easy evaluation of predictive performance for different rate prediction approaches as forward projection of last observations, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models and a specific Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort Model. Both INLA and classical Maximum Likelihood approaches can be used for GLMs and GAMs.
